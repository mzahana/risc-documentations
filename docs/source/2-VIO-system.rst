Building Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) System
=====================

VIO is used to estimate motion  based on vision and inertial sensors. It can be used as an onboard localization system to help a robot to navigate autonomously without needing a GPS.

In this tutorial, the goal it to provide a step-by-step guide on how to build and use a VIO system. The minimum hardware requirements is a camera, Arduino, and an IMU. More details on the example hardware components can be found in the hardware section.

This guid is divided into three main parts.

* Building VI sensor
* Using the VI sensor with a VIO pacakge for odometry estimation
* Integrating the odometry system with a drone for autonomous navigation
